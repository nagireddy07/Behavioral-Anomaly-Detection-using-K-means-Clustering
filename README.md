In todayâ€™s digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive information and infrastructure 
from insider threats is critical for organizational security. This project, titled "Anomaly 
Detection through Behavior Analysis," aims to detect insider attacks by analyzing employee 
behavior patterns within the corporate environment. The approach leverages unsupervised 
machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to group data based on 
behavioral similarities and establish baseline patterns. 
To capture sequential dependencies in user actions, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) 
are employed, enabling the identification of anomalous activity based on deviation from 
expected behavioral sequences. Furthermore, to enhance anomaly detection precision, the 
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is integrated, allowing the identification of localized 
anomalies that may go unnoticed at a global level. By combining these techniques, the 
model is designed to provide a robust multi- layered detection system that accurately flags 
potentially malicious activities, improving response times to insider threats and contributing 
to organizational resilience.
